# GameOfLife-HugoAuperin-CDOF4

The Game of Life is a famous game by mathematician John Horton Conway that we have to make console-based. To do so, we shall use spaces for dead cells and `#` for live cells.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them: Python 3.x

You can install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing

A step-by-step series of instructions to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hugaup/GameOfLife-HugoAuperin-CDOF4.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd GameOfLife-HugoAuperin-CDOF4
```

3. Run the Python script: 
```bash
python game_of_life.py
```

End with running the script and observing the console-based game in action.

## Running the tests

You can then directly exectue the program and observe the console to see if it works

### Break down into end-to-end tests

Check that the game actually updates correctly after each generation

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why: Example: Verify that the code adheres to PEP8 coding standards.

## Deployment

To deploy this project on a live system, ensure Python is installed on the system. You can execute the script from the terminal, and the game will run in the console.
